            <h2>A brief history of Mercedes-Benz</h2>
            <p>
                The patent motor car was developed by Carl Benz in the late 1800s
                and was the first of it's kind, <br>
                Many did not believe his new motor car would succeed. <br>
                Upon exiting the company one of Benz's investors told him "I'd forget about the motor car if I were you" <br>
                But Carl Benz continued his works creating motor cars that gradually spread across germany. <br>
                In the early 1920's after the great war and economic troubles DMG and Benz& Cie. <br> 
                The two oldest motor car producers in the world merged to form the now known Daimler AG, <br>
                and their symbol was a merging of the mercedes star of Daimler and the laurel wreath of Benz.
